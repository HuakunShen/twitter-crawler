[remove-duplicate-image.py](./remove-duplicate-image.py) can be used to remove duplicate images in a directory in place.

```bash
python remove-duplicate-image.py <path to dataset>
```

The script depends on [imagededup](https://github.com/idealo/imagededup).

Python 3.8 works, 3.10 doesn't, didn't try 3.9.
